## R Markdown

This is an <ins>R Markdown document</ins>. Markdown <ins>is</ins> a <del>simple</del> formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.`r trackchanger::comment("test")`

When you click the **Knit** <del>button</del> a document will be <del>generated</del> that includes both <del>content</del> as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can <del>embed</del> an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
enable_track_changes()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
